# Making a Lesson Plan
Lesson plans can be anything from a small workshop, to a week long session. They can be separated in chunks however you may like for the event.

Keep in mind that whenever you want to run something on the Arduino, that there is only one .ino file running at a time. So separating .ino files out for each separate activity in the workshop is recommended.

It is also recommended to make these verbose. Switching between several activities can take time and be frustrating, so including schematics on how things should be hooked up can make these sessions go a lot smoother. These schematics can be taken from the schematics folder in this repo. However, you might only find very general ones in there. If you need something more specific, you will have to create your own.
