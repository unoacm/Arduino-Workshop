# Campfire
This activity simulates a campfire with LEDs. LEDs are placed around a light sensor, and by pressing a button, the "fire" gets fueled and will light up. As long as the light sensor has enough light, the fire will keep going. Overtime, the fire will start to flicker and eventually burn out. Press the button a few times to fuel it again.

## This activity requires:
* LED: 3
* 100 ohm Resistors: 5
* Light Sensor: 1
* Button: 1
