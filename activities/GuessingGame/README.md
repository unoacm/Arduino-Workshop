# Guessing Game
This activity uses 8 lights to display a number from 1-255 in binary, that the user then has to guess what decimal number it is. If the user gets it right, a little jingle is given, and a new number is displayed. If they get it wrong, it flashes at them and they must guess again.

## This activity requires:
* Diodes: 8
* 100 ohm Resistors: 8
